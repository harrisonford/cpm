# cpm - harrisonford's fork

This is fork from this project called [cpm](https://github.com/psycharo) which comes as a well greeted attempt 
to use Tensorflow in this [convolutional pose model](https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release)
 made originally in Caffe (yuck).
 
 In my fork I contribute with some healthy practices, such as adding a requirements file in case you want to run
 the jupyter notebook on Binder or make a virtual environment easily using pip.

## Getting Started

As promised, you can run this on binder.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/harrisonford/cpm/master?filepath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fharrisonford%2Fcpm%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fexample.ipynb)

For the code to run we need to download the pre-trained structures, which are not inside this code because they tend
to weight a ton. You can have them stored on your PC or also have them in a cloud somewhere.
TODO: Where will I save the models? psycharo made them available through his drive 
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw6m_66JSYLld0NESGQ4QUNEdFk).


### Installing

It's highly advised to make your own virtual environment with pip, you can followthe steps listed
 in their docs [here.](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/)


## Contributing

I'm alone and single for now.
